Version 1- 
* Running theme- tried to turn a K into a person running- I love to run
* using an arm and a leg as the arms of the K
   * Kept looking like a person dancing or falling backwards instead of a runner
   * Some iterations of the person looked like a person running and some looked like a K but never both 
* Made block letter P next to the K inscribed inside a circle
Version 2- 
* Transitioned to rowing theme with my initals-- GPK III
* I know many rowing logos have the oars crossed behind a letter or a logo, so I did that with my initials
   * Started with a rough sketch where I traced GPK in Garamond font and freehand drew the oars behind it
   * I had to play around with the angle of the oars and the size of the blades to look natural but still clean and appropriately sized
Version 3- 
* More closely traced the letters and shifted to Times New Roman font because it was cleaner and more consistent across the letters
* Changed the angle to make sure it was the same for both angles from the same center point 
* Made less overlap between the letters and the III at the end
